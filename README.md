### Automation Settings
In this section, you can select your preferred language and testing framework 

### OpenAI API key
Entering the Open AI API key sets this key to be used for all OpenAI requests. 
Doing this also enables the dropdown to select more powerful models.
  - Enter your OpenAI API key on the first text input (the one with the placeholder "Your OpenAI API key").

For more information on how to create an API key, navigate to [OpenAI API Reference - Authentication](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/authentication)

### Server URL
Entering a server URL enables you to use your own TestCraft API deployed in your organization's infrastructure.
Doing this also enables the dropdown to select more powerful models.
  - Enter your server URL on the second text input (the one with the placeholder "Your server URL").

For more information on how to deploy the TestCraft API in your infrastructure, navigate to [TestCraft API Documentation](https://github.com/TestCraft-App/test-craft-api-v1?tab=readme-ov-file#testcraft-api)

### Select Your Model 
This dropdown allows you to select between the available models (more coming soon).  
  
Because of the costs involved, `gpt-3.5-turbo` is selected by default and the dropdown is disabled. To enable the other models, you need to set the [OpenAI API key](#openai-api-key) or the [Server URL](#server-url).  
  
For more information about OpenAI models, navigate to [OpenAI API Reference - Models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/overview)  
  
In case you want to explore other models without setting up the OpenAI API key or the server URL, contact us at contact@testcraft.app.
